- Don’t aim to have others like you; aim to have them respect you.
- You are given the gift of life in order to discover what your gift *in* life is. You will complete your mission when you figure out what your mission is. This is not a paradox. This is the way.
- The greatest rewards come from working on something that nobody has a name for. If you possibly can, work where there are no words for what you do.
- If your goal does not have a schedule, it is a dream.
- Finite games are played to win or lose. Infinite games are played to keep the game going. Seek out infinite games because they yield infinite rewards.
-  If you can avoid seeking approval of others, your power is limitless.
- Don’t create things to make money; make money so you can create things. The reward for good work is more work.
- All the greatest gains in life — in wealth, relationships, or knowledge —come from the magic of compounding interest — amplifying small steady gains. All you need for abundance is to keep adding 1% more than you subtract on a regular basis.
- Your passion in life should fit you exactly; but your purpose in life should exceed you. Work for something much larger than yourself.
- Be governed not by the tyranny of the urgent but by the elevation of the important.
- Your work will be endless, but your time is finite. You cannot limit the work so you must limit your time. Hours are the only thing you can manage.
- Many backward steps are made by standing still.
- The greatest teacher is called “doing”.
- It is much easier to change how you think by changing your behavior, than it is to change your behavior by changing how you think. Act out the change you seek.
- A multitude of bad ideas is necessary for one good idea.
- Being wise means having more questions than answers.
- Finding the right way of formulating the problem is often half of what it takes to solve it.
- History teaches us that in 100 years from now some of the assumptions you believed will turn out to be wrong. A good question to ask yourself today is “What might I be wrong about?”
- You don't travel to see different things, you travel to see things differently.
- The foundation of maturity: Just because it’s not your fault doesn’t mean it’s not your responsibility.
- That thing that made you weird as a kid could make you great as an adult — if you don’t lose it.
- Bad things can happen fast, but almost all good things happen slowly.
- Be the change you wish to see.
- On the way to a grand goal, celebrate the smallest victories as if each one were the final goal. No matter where it ends you are victorious.
- Recipe for success: under-promise and over-deliver.
- Don’t worry how or where you begin. As long as you keep moving, your success will be far from where you start.
-  Most overnight successes — in fact any significant successes — take at least 5 years. Budget your life accordingly.
- Every person you meet knows an amazing lot about something you know virtually nothing about. Your job is to discover what it is, and it won’t be obvious.
- Contemplating the weaknesses of others is easy; contemplating the weaknesses in yourself is hard, but it pays a much higher reward.
-  Be strict with yourself and forgiving of others. The reverse is hell for everyone.
-  Compliment people behind their back. It’ll come back to you.
-  Your best response to an insult is “You’re probably right.” Often they are.
-  When a child asks an endless string of “why?” questions, the smartest reply is, “I don’t know, what do you think?”
- Always say less than necessary
- Sustained outrage makes you stupid.
- Children totally accept — and crave — family rules. “In our family we have a rule for X” is the only excuse a parent needs for setting a family policy. In fact, “I have a rule for X” is the only excuse you need for your own personal policies.
- Learn how to tie a bowline knot. Practice in the dark. With one hand. For the rest of your life you’ll use this knot more times than you would ever believe.
-  When you confront a stuck bolt or screw: righty tighty, lefty loosey.
- Each time you reach out to people, bring them a blessing; then they’ll be happy to see you when you bring them a problem.
- The best way to untangle a knotty tangle is not to “untie” the knots, but to keep pulling the loops apart wider and wider. Just make the mess as big, loose and open as possible. As you open up the knots they will unravel themselves. Works on cords, strings, hoses, yarns, or electronic cables.
- Writing down one thing you are grateful for each day is the cheapest possible therapy ever.
• A worthy goal for a year is to learn enough about a subject so that you can’t believe how ignorant you were a year earlier.
• Don’t be the best. Be the only.
• Learn how to learn from those you disagree with, or even offend you. See if you can find the truth in what they believe.
• Don’t be afraid to ask a question that may sound stupid because 99% of the time everyone else is thinking of the same question and is too embarrassed to ask it.
• Being enthusiastic is worth 25 IQ points.
• Don’t trust all-purpose glue.
• Gratitude will unlock all other virtues and is something you can get better at.
• If you are not falling down occasionally, you are just coasting.
• The universe is conspiring behind your back to make you a success. This will be much easier to do if you embrace this pronoia.
• Extraordinary claims should require extraordinary evidence to be believed.
• Don’t take it personally when someone turns you down. Assume they are like you: busy, occupied, distracted. Try again later. It’s amazing how often a second try works.
• Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to them, they are waiting for you to send them an email, they are waiting for you to ask them on a date. Go ahead.
• A vacation + a disaster = an adventure.
• Show up. Keep showing up. Somebody successful said: 99% of success is just showing up.
• Being able to listen well is a superpower. While listening to someone you love keep asking them “Is there more?”, until there is no more.
• Promptness is a sign of respect.
• Trust me: There is no “them”.
• The more you are interested in others, the more interesting they find you. To be interesting, be interested.
• Optimize your generosity. No one on their deathbed has ever regretted giving too much away.
• The Golden Rule (the principle of treating others as one wants to be treated) will never fail you. It is the foundation of all other virtues.
• Reading to your children regularly will bond you together and kickstart their imaginations.
• Always demand a deadline. A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. It prevents you from trying to make it perfect, so you have to make it different. Different is better.
• Treating a person to a meal never fails, and is so easy to do. It’s powerful with old friends and a great way to make new friends.
• Don’t be the smartest person in the room. Hangout with, and learn from, people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people who will disagree with you.
• Rule of 3 in conversation. To get to the real reason, ask a person to go deeper than what they just said. Then again, and once more. The third time’s answer is close to the truth.
• The Golden Rule will never fail you. It is the foundation of all other virtues.
• If you are looking for something in your house, and you finally find it, when you’re done with it, don’t put it back where you found it. Put it back where you first looked for it.
• Saving money and investing money are both good habits. Small amounts of money invested regularly for many decades without deliberation is one path to wealth.
• To make mistakes is human. To own your mistakes is divine. Nothing elevates a person higher than quickly admitting and taking personal responsibility for the mistakes you make and then fixing them fairly. If you mess up, fess up. It’s astounding how powerful this ownership is.
• You can obsess about serving your customers/audience/clients, or you can obsess about beating the competition. Both work, but of the two, obsessing about your customers will take you further.
• Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can’t write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select. While you sketch, don’t inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgement.
• Perhaps the most counter-intuitive truth of the universe is that the more you give to others, the more you’ll get. Understanding this is the beginning of wisdom.
• Friends are better than money. Almost anything money can do, friends can do better. In so many ways a friend with a boat is better than owning a boat.
• This is true: It’s hard to cheat an honest man.
• When an object is lost, 95% of the time it is hiding within arm’s reach of where it was last seen. Search in all possible locations in that radius and you’ll find it.
• You are what you do. Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you vote, but what you spend your time on.
